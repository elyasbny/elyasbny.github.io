Welcome to my website !\
I completed the [MVA (Mathematics, Vision and Learning)](https://www.master-mva.com/) master at ENS Paris-Saclay, after gaining previous research experience at EPFL (Lausanne), King’s College (London), and Oxford (UK), as well as industry experience. I have a strong focus on applied mathematics, machine learning, and computer vision, and on this site I’ll be sharing some of my machine learning and data science [projects](/projects).\
I am also a teaching assistant ([Louis-Le-Grand](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand), [Condorcet](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Condorcet) and [Saint-Nicolas](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Saint-Nicolas_(Paris))), giving *colles* in mathematics for classe préparatoire students. You can find some of the documents I prepared for my students [here](https://kholle.com).\
I am currently working at Amazon, where I focus on robustness evaluation and distribution shift in machine learning models.
