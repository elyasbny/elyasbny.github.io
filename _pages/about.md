Welcome to my website !\
I’m a French student completing [MVA (Mathematics, Vision and Learning)](https://www.master-mva.com/) master at ENS Paris-Saclay, with a strong interest in applied mathematics, machine learning and computer vision. On this site, I’ll be sharing some of my machine learning and data science projects.\
I am also a teaching assistant ([Louis-Le-Grand](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand), [Condorcet](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Condorcet) and [Saint-Nicolas](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Saint-Nicolas_(Paris)), giving "colles" in mathematics for classe préparatoire students. You can find some of the documents I prepared for my students [here](/teaching).
